# Captin
Lightweight custom module execution through python:


#add_ons

there is only one package in the add_ons directory, it is 'IPPF.py' :: this module contains two functions: Whois && GeoIp

more add_ons are avalable and will be distrobuted in a separate directory. 


there will be a template published for custom modules: 

when adding modules to the directory understand that unless the module has been used before or is verified, it will not run.
